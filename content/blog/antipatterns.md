  * Boiling the ocean
  * Big bang deliveries
  * Developer portals
  * Abstracting the cloud from your engineers
  * Multi-cloud
  * Implementing tooling beyond your maturity
  * Ignoring boring, simple fixes in favour of shiny tech
  * Run the company on your laptop
  * Concurrent microservice development without contract testing
  * Access control that isn't role-based
  * Depriving staff of agency
  * Security teams
  * Conflating one-way doors with two-way doors (decisions)
  * Using features simply because they exist
  * Architects
  * Gitops
  * Git branch strategies that aren't trunk-based
  * Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend
  * Liveness checks that rely on downstream systems
  * Thinking load balancers and DNS aren't good enough
  * Telling yourself you'll make that pipeline stage automatic later on
  * Monorepos
  * Troubleshooting through the pipeline
